This is a C# porting of [kvs-tools](https://github.com/Hairo/kvs-tools).

It's incomplete but I have no plan to carry on anytime soon.

What has to be done:
  - parse untouched .ktsl2asbin,
  - update the position of each track
  - update any other information required

.ktsl2asbin file format is [partially covered](https://github.com/Attacktive/kvs-tools-csharp/wiki/The-Headers#2).
